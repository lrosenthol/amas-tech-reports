== Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive overview of various standards and specifications related to digital media, focusing on content provenance, trust authenticity, asset identifiers, opt-out mechanisms, and watermarking. These standards are essential for ensuring the authenticity of both synthetic and non-synthetic digital content. As generative AI continues to evolve, the need for robust standards becomes increasingly critical to protect the interests of creators, consumers, and organizations.

The standards discussed in this report are developed by various Standard Development Organizations (SDOs) and groups, each contributing to different aspects of AI and authenticity. By adhering to these guidelines, organizations can maintain the trustworthiness and provenance of their digital assets, ensuring that content remains authentic and traceable throughout its lifecycle.

=== Approach
The approach taken in this report involves a thorough review of existing standards and specifications related to digital media. The focus is on identifying key areas where standards already exist, and from that, what are still are needed to ensure the authenticity and integrity of digital content. From that review, we have broken this report into the categories: content provenance, trust and authenticity, asset identifiers, opt-out mechanisms, and watermarking.

== Categories of Standards
=== Content Provenance

Content provenance refers to the documentation of the origin and history of digital content. It is crucial for verifying the authenticity and integrity of digital assets. Provenance information helps in tracking the creation, modification, and distribution of content, providing a transparent record that can be used to establish trust and accountability. This is particularly important in contexts where the authenticity of content is paramount, such as in journalism, scientific research, and digital art.
